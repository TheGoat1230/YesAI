# YesAI

YesAI is written in Python using the PIL (Pillow) library. It takes images (.png/.jpg/.jpeg) and removes the metadata, clearing out any AI related information from the header. This was written with the sole intention of testing and is not meant to harm artists. If an artist does not want their work used, respect it!

# How do I use it?

It's pretty straight forward.

1) Install Python
2) Install the PIL (Pillow) library
3) Place your images in the same directory as the .py file
4) Double click the .py file and your images will be saved as "filename_yesai.extension"

# Does it work?

See for yourself!
